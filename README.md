## Instructions

This is my take on the "Classic Arcade Game" project from Udacity's "Front End Web Developer" nanodegree course.

### To set up the game:

- Download this project from this repository
- Open the file "index.html" in your browser of choice
- The game will start automatically

### Object of the game:

- Earn as many points as you can, by reaching the water and by collecting gems while avoiding the bugs

### To play the game:

- Use the arrow keys to move the player avatar from the bottom of the screen to the water at the top
- You can cycle through five different player avatars by pressing the Home key
- If you reach the water, you earn 100 points and the player is reset to its starting position
- Gems will appear in random squares at random times; move onto a square to collect the gem and earn points
- Avoid the bugs that glide across the screen from left to right; if you collide with a bug, you will lose a life
- After you lose four lives, the game is over; a modal dialog will display your final score and offer you the chance to play again

## Enhancements

These enhancements have been added to the game (beyond the minimum spec):

- There are sound effects for moving player, reaching water, collecting gem, hitting bug, game over
- You can mute the sound effects by checking the cheskbox in the "Game Over" dialog
- Cycle through player avatars by pressing "Home" button on keyboard
- Gems appear randomly and collecting them earns extra points
- The scoreboard at the top of the game board shows the selected player avatar, the number of lives remaining and the current score
